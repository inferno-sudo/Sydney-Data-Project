# Sydney Weather vs Transport Usage Analysis
### Phase 1
## Issue -
The effect of wearther on public transport usage.

### Hypothesis -
" *Daily rainfall in Sydney decreases the rate of usage of public transport* "
### Mind map
![Sydney Weather Graph](Mindmap.png)

## Purpose Statements -
1. To verify if there is a clear distinct decrease in the usage of Public transport in Sydney on days with higher rainfall. 
2. To access and interact with Sydney weather and transport datasets through the program's user interface


### Functional and Non-functional requirements
#### Functional Requirements -
 - Insert and combine daily rainfall and public transport usage datasets
 - Showcase the correlation between usage and weather
 - Create graphs that visualize the data
 - Produce a text-based user interface that allows for: </br> Selecting a data range </br> Looking at the viewer statistics </br> Displaying the graphs

#### Non-functional Requirements -
 - Program running under a certain amount of time for a years worth of data
 - Graphs should be clear and concise
 - Data handling must be perfect (Zero room for mistakes or error)
 - Easy to use GUI


### Phase 2 
## Research
Rainfall reduces instances of public transport in wet weather because it discourages people from utilising public means of transport such as buses, trains or ferrys. By this I mean rain might make it unfriendly to walk to a station or stop, delay services and increase the need to drive. A study conducted in 2019, in NSW proved that ferry usages dropped drastically during storms and further UK studies show that bus usage drop slightly in occurence to rain. All of this is very significant as if the relationship is directly proportional, city planners could increase shelter infraststructure or adjust schedules for rainer days. 

### Finding the data/Data dicitonary -
#### Finding the Data - 
- Daily Rainfall Data - Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) and Sydney Observatory Hill data CSV
- Transport data usage - Transport for NSW opal Tap on/off counts by date
- Merge both datasets on date

| Field Name | Source | Description |Data-Type |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| Date | BOM/TfNSW | Day of Observation | Date |
| Rainfall (mm) | BOM | Total Daily Rainfall in Milimeters | Float |
| Max Temp (Degrees Celcius) | BOM | Maximum Temperature for the Day | Float |
| Train on time (Percentage) | TfNSW | Percentage of trains arriving on time | Float |
| Bus on time (Percentage) | TfNSW | Percentage of buses arriving on time | Float |
| Ferry on time (Percentage) | TfNSW | Percentage of ferrys arriving on time | Float | 
  
### Phase 4
## Final Analysis 
To portray that rainfall makes a negative impact on the usage of public transport is to say that rain deters people from using buses, trains or ferrys. By this I mean that there was in fact a correaltion in the amount of daily rain compared to the amounts of usage of public transport. For example, my analysis shows that the corealtion coefficent is of -0.42 over the course of 12 months, therefore meaning that heavier amounts of percipitation tends to coincide with fewer trips. 

## Peer Review -
#### Quintus -
Plus -
The data generated by the program are easy to read, presenting transport and weather data. The graphs effectively summarize large datasets, making it easy for both casual users and analysts to understand. 

Minus -
While the graphs provide a useful overall picture, the data is mixed up and doesnt distinguish means of public transport. This limitation prevents users from reviewing performance issues specific to individual services or routes, which could be very important. 

Implication - 
The combination of clear pictures and mixed data allows for simple insights into transport and weather trends, but for city planners or transport managers more detailed data would be necessary to make precise decisions. 

#### Mine for him -
Plus -
The visualizations are clear and easy to understand, summarising data effectively for quick insights.
Minus - 
Data is spread across different types, so specifics not shown.
Implication - 
Useful for general trends, but detailed, disaggregated data is needed.           


#### Karna - 
Plus  - 
The Python scripts included in the project are very easy to understand. The modular design of the code, with clearly defined functions and readable syntax, ensures that it is userfriendly.

Minus -
The program relies on CSV files being formatted exactly as expected, meaning any differnecs in structure could result in errors or failed execution. Thislack of flexibility may require additional preprocessing or troubleshooting. 

Implication -
While the code is highly accessible and user-friendly, care must be taken to ensure input data is structured. Future improvements could include more error handling to improve usability.

#### Mine for him -

Plus -
The project explores a relevant and interesting topic.
Minus -         
Findings are limited so results may not apply to other cities without additional analysis.        
Implication -          
Expanding to other cities could allow comparative studies and broader conclusions.   

#### Will -

Plus -
The topic of analysing the relationship between weather patterns and transport performance in Sydney is both interesting and highly relevant. By combining meteorological data with transport performance metrics, the project provides a rich context for discussion and exploration and may influence public transport efficiency and reliability.

Minus -
The scope of the project is currently limited to Sydney. Localised factors mean that similar analyses would need to be conducted independently for other areas, shallowing the results.

Implication -
Although the project demonstrates valuable insights for Sydney, expanding the dataset to include other major cities could allow for comparative studies.

#### Mine for him -

Plus -
Python scripts are simple to run, with modular code that is readable and allows basic manipulation and analysis of the datasets. 
Minus -
Requires CSV files to match exact formatting, which can cause errors if data structure differs.        
Implication                
Accessible for the intended dataset, but future versions could include error handling for flexibility.


## Project Evaluation -
Against Requirements Outline:
All of the functional requirements outlined at the start of the project have been met. The program executes efficiently, the graphs produced are clear allowing users to gain insights into the relationship between weather patterns and transport performance without requiring prior technical knowledge.

Against Peer Feedback:
Feedback from peers suggested that utilising a more detailed breakdown by individual transport type—trains, buses, and ferries—would make the analysis better. This improvement has been understood for next time, incorporating these features will allow users to identify specific areas of strength or weakness in each mode of transport.

Against Project Management:
The project did not stay on track according to the planned schedule. Most of the development and analysis milestones were not able to be achieved on time. As additional time was required for cleaning and standardising the datasets, particularly because the data came from multiple sources with slightly different formats. But careful planning ensured that the overall timeline was still met, and the project was finished.

Against Data & Security:
The data used in the project is sourced from very reliable sources, including the Bureau of Meteorology and Transport for NSW, which ensures high quality. Since no personal data is included, privacy risks are minimal. Nonetheless, security could be improved by rather than relying on manual downloads which risk data tampering or corruption during transfer a HTTPs fetching based system could be placed.

Accessibility:
The program’s text-based interface is compatible with any environment, which ensures broad accessibility. Though, the user experience could be further enhanced by developing a graphical user interface (GUI). A GUI would make the program more intuitive and visually engaging which would help the user interact with the datasets and generate charts more easily.

## Conclusion -
In conclusion it is fair to say that my hypothesis stayed correct though more analysis could have been used in order to further support my research.
